# Algorithm In Cython
&emsp;&emsp;This is a repository to realize the algorithms in many fields. 
In fact, I use C, Cython and Python to do my work.

# Parts
## All C
&emsp;&emsp;There are some algorithm and little useless skills in C.

## include
&emsp;&emsp;There are all include head files.

## lib
&emsp;&emsp;There are all modules files.

## ML
&emsp;&emsp;There are machine learning algorithms. 
Every directory corresponds a algorithm realized in Cython.
The `setup.py` is used to set up the module.
The `test.ipynb` tests the module.
